## DATABASE IMPLEMENTATION REPORT

### 1. PROJECT ANALYSIS
- **Data requirements assessment**: The clothing shop requires a database to manage users, products, orders, and shopping cart items. Each user can have multiple orders and shopping cart items. Products need to be categorized and can have various attributes such as size, color, and price.
- **Scalability and performance needs**: The database should handle a growing number of users and products efficiently, with quick access to product information and order history.
- **Compliance and security requirements**: User data must be stored securely, adhering to data protection regulations. Sensitive information like passwords should be encrypted.

### 2. DATABASE STRATEGY
- **Database type selection**: A relational database (PostgreSQL) is selected due to the structured nature of the data and the need for complex queries and relationships.
- **Technology stack rationale**: PostgreSQL is chosen for its robustness, support for complex queries, and strong community support.
- **Data modeling approach**: An Entity-Relationship Model (ERM) will be used to define the relationships between users, products, orders, and shopping cart items.

### 3. IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

#### 3.1 Database Setup
- **Database Engine**: PostgreSQL is selected for its advanced features and performance.
- **Version Requirements**: PostgreSQL version 13 or higher is recommended for optimal performance and features.
- **Connection Configuration**: Connection strings will be configured for development, staging, and production environments using connection pooling.
- **Environment Setup**: Separate databases for development, staging, and production will be established to ensure data integrity and security.

#### 3.2 Schema Design
- **Entity Relationship Model**: The following entities will be defined:
  - Users
  - Products
  - Orders
  - Shopping Cart Items

- **Table Specifications**:
  - **Users**:  
    - `id`: SERIAL PRIMARY KEY  
    - `username`: VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL  
    - `email`: VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL  
    - `password_hash`: VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL  
    - `created_at`: TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP  
    - `updated_at`: TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP  
  
  - **Products**:  
    - `id`: SERIAL PRIMARY KEY  
    - `name`: VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL  
    - `description`: TEXT  
    - `price`: DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL  
    - `stock_quantity`: INT NOT NULL  
    - `created_at`: TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP  
    - `updated_at`: TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP  
  
  - **Orders**:  
    - `id`: SERIAL PRIMARY KEY  
    - `user_id`: INT REFERENCES Users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE  
    - `order_date`: TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP  
    - `status`: VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL  
    - `total_amount`: DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL  
  
  - **Shopping Cart Items**:  
    - `id`: SERIAL PRIMARY KEY  
    - `user_id`: INT REFERENCES Users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE  
    - `product_id`: INT REFERENCES Products(id) ON DELETE CASCADE  
    - `quantity`: INT NOT NULL  
    - `added_at`: TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP  

- **Relationship Mapping**:
  - Users to Orders: One-to-Many  
  - Users to Shopping Cart Items: One-to-Many  
  - Products to Shopping Cart Items: One-to-Many  

- **Naming Conventions**: All table names will be pluralized (e.g., `Users`, `Products`, `Orders`, `ShoppingCartItems`). Column names will be in snake_case.
- **Data Types**: Optimal data types have been selected based on the nature of the data.

#### 3.3 Indexing Strategy
- **Primary Indexes**: Primary keys are defined for all tables.
- **Secondary Indexes**: Indexes on `username`, `email`, and `product_id` for faster lookups.
- **Composite Indexes**: None required at this stage.
- **Query Optimization**: Indexes will be used for common queries such as fetching user orders and shopping cart items.
- **Index Maintenance**: Regular monitoring of index usage and performance will be conducted.
